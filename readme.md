AlgoDesk

AlgoDesk is a long-term Python project focused on paper trading and strategy simulation.
The goal is to build a flexible platform for experimenting with trading logic, portfolio management, and risk control â€” entirely without real money.

This project is actively evolving and updated continuously, with no defined end date.
